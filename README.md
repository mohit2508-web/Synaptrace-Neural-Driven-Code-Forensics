# 🛡️ Synaptrace: Neural-Driven Code Forensics

> High-Fidelity AI Code Detection & Authenticity Intelligence Platform

---

## 🚀 Overview

**Synaptrace** is a high-fidelity forensic analysis platform built to distinguish between organic human-authored code and synthetic AI-generated logic.

By bridging the gap between **MERN-stack orchestration** and **Python-driven machine learning**, Synaptrace analyzes the **"Pulse"** and **"DNA"** of a codebase to provide a definitive authenticity score.

## 🎯 The Mission

As LLMs like GPT-4 and Claude become integrated into every developer's workflow, the line between original thought and generated output is blurring.

Synaptrace provides powerful tools for:

- 🎓 **Academic Integrity** – Detect automated assignment completion  
- 💼 **Talent Acquisition** – Verify the fingerprint of a candidate's portfolio  
- 🔐 **IP Protection** – Audit codebases for undocumented or hallucinated AI contributions

## 🧠 Multi-Layer Analysis Engine

Synaptrace goes beyond simple text comparison. It analyzes structure, behavior, and statistical signals across four advanced dimensions:

---

### 1️⃣ Logic-Tree Synthesis (AST Analysis)

- Deconstructs code into its **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**
- Compares logical structures against a proprietary library of known LLM signature patterns
- Detects machine logic even when variables and formatting are modified

---

### 2️⃣ Stylometry Profiling

- Detects subtle **"Human Noise"**
- Identifies idiosyncratic naming patterns and irregular nesting
- Measures:
  - Variable Name Entropy
  - Comment Tone Consistency

---

### 3️⃣ The Perplexity Matrix

- Uses NLP models to measure token predictability
- Human code tends to be irregular and bursty
- AI-generated code typically follows smooth, low-perplexity distributions

---

### 4️⃣ Behavioral Biometrics (Keystroke Analysis)

- Analyzes rhythm of code insertion
- Differentiates between:
  - Organic human typing cadence
  - Instant paste signatures of AI-assisted generation
